Once we have compiled our SC. We will be doing the Following:

-   Deploy to a Testnet.
-   Interact and Test with Ethers.js
-   Optimise the Gas Consumption and Behaviour
-   Verify on Etherscan (Testnet);

Service that Users can subscribe to by paying ETH and the owner of the Contract can withdraw funds

Now we have created the SC and test. We need to create the Deployment Script and the Actual Deployment.

-   Log on to Infura.io and create an Account.
